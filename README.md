## About the Project

This application is for users to get their best 9 photos in a grid layout. They will upload all
the photos they have and after uploading, weâ€™ll let them select the best 9 photos and their order. They
can alter their selection and order anytime by visiting the application again.


 #### Attention


The provided endpoint ( https://dev-pb-apps.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/collection/CHhASmTpKjaHyAsSaauThRqMMjWanYkQ.json ) for getting uploaded photos retrieves entries with picture URL, https://placeimg.com/2560/2560/any. which generates a random picture every time it's called. Also, the id property can not be used to get a unique picture.
Therefore I had to optimize default JSON with uploaded photo details. It's served from one of the endpoints in Node Application. Below I have stated part of both JSON.

I utilized https://i.ibb.co to store photos and also to fetch them.

##### default JSON

```json
{
	"id": 2270,
	"code": "CHhASmTpKjaHyAsSaauThRqMMjWanYkQ",
	"startDate": 1578391244,
	"endDate": null,

	"is_shareable": true,
	"entries": [{

	}]
}

```
